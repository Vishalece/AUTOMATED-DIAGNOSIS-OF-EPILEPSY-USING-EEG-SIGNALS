# AUTOMATED-DIAGNOSIS-OF-EPILEPSY-USING-EEG-SIGNALS(powered by Intel oneAPI)

This project focuses on detecting an epilepsy disease,which is an  is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations and sometimes loss of awareness,by providing DL & ML solution.

**Problem statement:** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Despite advances in diagnostic techniques and treatments, epilepsy remains a challenging disease to diagnose accurately and manage effectively. There is a need for a reliable and non-invasive method of detecting epilepsy that can aid in early diagnosis and treatment, and improve the quality of life for those living with this condition. The development of an accurate and effective method for detecting epilepsy could potentially reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.

**Solution:** The solution for the above problem is developing a 1D CNN model capable of detecting epilepsy, training the model with a training and validation dataset, evaluating the model's performance with a separate testing dataset, and tuning the hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance. Using a 1D CNN for detecting epilepsy has shown promising results in accurately detecting seizures by capturing temporal features in the data.And checking the detection with other models to find the best model for classification between normal person and ectal person.

# WHY ONEAPI
![logo-oneapi-rwd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90272634/230717338-f2dc33e7-31df-4dc0-98f1-9074cb7252e2.png)

Intel oneAPI is a suite of development tools for creating software that can run on a variety of platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. It includes a number of components, such as compilers, libraries, and tools for performance analysis and debugging. The advantage of using oneAPI is that it allows developers to write code once and run it on a variety of hardware platforms, which can save time and effort.

## Toolkit used: Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit)

In this project we have used different machine learning models which **increses the the runtime when we take time series data of EEG signal from brain through sensors( small metal discs also called EEG electrodes ) after filtering and sampling the signals**.This causes delay in processing the data in the systems with limited processing power.**The Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) helps to resolve this problem by providing better results by optimising the models**.We use deep learning API like keras which  are optimized for the Intel architecture by the oneAPI platform and further boosts the inference of the models.Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a popular Python library for machine learning, but it may not be optimized for Intel hardware by default.By integrating oneAPI into scikit-learn, the performance of some of its algorithms, such as linear regression, can be significantly improved.**integrating oneAPI into scikit-learn can improve its performance on Intel hardware by taking advantage of highly optimized libraries and routines for mathematical computations and data analysis**.

✅Building application using intel oneAPI:Intel oneAPI is a suite of development tools for creating software that can run on a variety of platforms..Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a popular Python library for machine learning, but it may not be optimized for Intel hardware by default.By integrating oneAPI into scikit-learn deployment of code into hardware will become more compatable.

✅Building a  Epilepsy detection application involves a significant amount of research and development. During the process, I likely learned a number of things, including: 

✅Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict epilepsy by extracting the features.

✅Data Analysis: I likely gained experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, including EEG signal data, to train our machine learning models.

✅Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as VLSI, machine learning,deep learning and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. 

Overall, building a epilepsy detecting device is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires both hardwarw and software knowledge on VLSI,IoT,machine learning and deep learning.This is my step to complete this challenging project by building a model for detection of epilepsy and we are in plan of deploying this codel in fpga with help of oneAPI and make an SoC(System on Chip) to make this prototype as wearable device.
